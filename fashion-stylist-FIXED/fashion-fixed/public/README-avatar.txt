Place your avatar_base.glb file in this /public folder.

Your GLB file must have these Shape Keys (Morph Targets):
  - hip_wide
  - waist_wide
  - bust_wide
  - height_tall
  - hip_thin      (optional)
  - waist_thin    (optional)

How to get a free GLB with morph targets:
──────────────────────────────────────────
Option 1 — Ready Player Me (easiest):
  1. Go to https://readyplayer.me
  2. Create a female avatar
  3. Export as GLB
  4. Open in Blender → add Shape Keys for hip/waist/bust/height
  5. Export as GLB again → place here as avatar_base.glb

Option 2 — Mixamo + Blender:
  1. Go to https://mixamo.com → pick a character
  2. Download T-pose FBX
  3. Import into Blender
  4. Add Shape Keys → export GLB

Option 3 — Quick test (no morph targets):
  Use any .glb humanoid file — the avatar will still show,
  just without body-proportion morphing.
  Download a free one from: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount&tag=character

NOTE: Without a GLB file the app shows a purple wireframe placeholder.
The rest of the app (analysis, measurements, try-on, recommendations) all works fully.
